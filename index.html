    <h1>CLOUD COMPUTING LABSS</h1>
    <p>
      Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers,
      storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over
      the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources,
      and economies of scale. Instead of owning their own computing
      infrastructure, companies can rent access to resources as needed from
      cloud service providers.
